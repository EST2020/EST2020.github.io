    <h1>Modeling of time-dependent systems: Energy transport and storage</h1>

    <p>
      This is the syllabus of the design-based learning project <em>Modeling of time-dependent systems: energy transport and storage</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Societal background</li>
      <li>Challenge based learning</li>
      <li>Project objective</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Model development and validation</h2>
    <p>To provide guidance for the development and validation of a model for an energy storage and transport system, the project is structured by the following phases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Phase 1: Defining your energy storage and transport system</li>
      <li>Phase 2: Exploring your modeling options</li>
      <li>Phase 3: ...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each of these phases, including the associated tasks and deliverables, are elaborated below. It is the responsibility of the group to make a planning that results in the timely completion of all deliverables.</p>

    <h3>Phase 1: Defining your energy storage and transport system</h3>

    <div class="block objective">
      <p>In this phase you will...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>...select an energy source and target, taking Figure X as inspiration.</li>
        <li>...define the technical concept for an energy storage and transport system with time-dependent behavior.</li>
        <li>...outline how the energy storage and transport solution can be applied in the real-world setting.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="block questions">
      <ul>
        <li>Is the complexity of your energy system in line with the competence level expected from second year engineering students?</li>
        <li>Are the stengths and weaknesses of your group taken into consideration in the selection of the energy system?</li>
        <li>Does your energy system strike a good balance between being innovative/creative and being realistic?</li>
        <li>Is it clear that the defined system shows time-dependent behavior?</li>
        <li>Is it realistic to expect that a component of the model of your energy system can be validated experimentally?</li>
      </ul>
