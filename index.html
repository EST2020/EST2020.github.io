    <h3 id="background">The energy transition: an engineering challenge</h3>
    <p>
    In 2015, all members of the United Nations agreed on an <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/">Agenda for Sustainable Development</a>, aimed at transforming the world by 2030. At the core of this agenda are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

    <p>
    In order to achieve these goals, fundamental changes in our energy system are required. The process of changing our energy system is referred to as the <em>energy transition</em>. Technological innovations across a wide range of disciplines are required to make our energy system sustainable.
    </p>

    <p>
    The energy transition poses tremendous challenges for engineers, both from a technological perspective and from the vantage point of sustainability. As an engineer of the future, you are expected to develop technology to enable the energy transition, while simultaneously taking into consideration the effects that this technology has on our lives.

    <p>
    A major technological challenge in the energy transition is to accommodate our energy system to deal with the more fluctuating nature of green energy sources compared to conventional (fossil fuel based) energy sources. Where conventional energy can be fully controlled, green energy depends on external factors over which we have limited control. In the current energy system, where the majority of energy still comes from fossil fuels, the fluctuations in green energy production are leveled out by conventional energy production. 
    </p>

    <p>
    In the western world, energy exchange markets (for example <a href="https://www.epexspot.com/">EPEX SPOT</a> in The Netherlands) regulate the supply and demand of energy. To improve the economic competitiveness of green energy sources on these markets, it is essential to make them less dependent on balancing by conventional energy sources. The ability to efficiently store green energy in situations when there is a surplus of production (for example, at night) and to deliver this stored energy when there is a surplus of demand (for example, during the day), is key to making green energy competitive. Currently, the storage capacity on the energy grid is limited. The development of innovative energy storage and transport technologies is essential to make green energy economically viable, and, thereby, to enable the energy transition. 
    </p>

    <p>

   In this project we make the distinction between two types of energy storage and transport systems:
   <ul>
   <li> 
      A <em>grid energy storage system</em> typically is a large-scale storage system connected to the electrical grid. Energy is collected in the grid energy storage system at times when there is plenty of (inexpensive) electrical energy, for example, during windy periods. This energy is then released to the electrical grid at times when there is a shortage of generated electricity. The connection to the electrical grid makes that these storage systems are operated within the regulations of the electrical energy exchange market.
    </li>
    <li> 
      In <em>energy recovery and recycling systems</em> a surplus of energy (thermal, electrical, chemical, etc.) at one moment is temporarily stored in order to be released at times of shortage, and/or the surplus is transported to a location where it can be made to good use. Such storage systems can vary from small-scale to large-scale applications, also with a significant variation in storage times. Energy recovery and recycling systems are often not operated on an exchange market, but are instead used as a peer-to-peer energy exchange system.
    </li>
    </ul>

    <p>For more information on energy storage and transport system we suggest the following references:</p>

    <h3 id="projectgoals">Project goals</h3>
    <p>The overarching goal of this project is defined as:</p>
    <div class="block projectgoals">
    	<p>
    	<b>
    	 To develop a mathematical-physical model for an energy storage and transport system, and to validate this model using experiments. Within the framework of challenge-based learning, the project groups independently define their own energy storage and transport solution.
    	</b>
    	</p>

    </div>

    <p>In the process of accomplishing this overarching objective, the following learning goals will be achieved:</p>

    <div class="block learninggoals">
    <p>In this project you will learn to...</p>
    <ol>
      <li> ...define an energy transport and storage system with time-dependent behavior. The complexity of the system should be in line with the competence level expected from a second year engineering student, and should take into account the strengths and weaknesses of your project group.</li>
      <li>...apply a predefined modeling cycle when developing and validating a model. In the early stages of the project, your group should be able to identify the key components and possible bottlenecks in the various modeling phases and to establish a time line for the modeling process.</li>
      <li>
      ...apply known mathematical-physical concepts to model the time-dependent behavior of the selected system. Your group should be able to identify key components of the system and describe at least one of these components by a differential equation.</li>
      <li>...reflect on the validity of the model, and to develop a plan to experimentally validate a crucial, time-dependent, component of the system.</li>
      <li>...design and build an experimental set-up, in order to validate the identified critical, time-dependent, component of the system. In designing the experiment, your group should focus on reproducibility and accuracy.</li>
      <li>...perform experiments and process and analyze experimental data following good statistical practice. Your group should be able to draw conclusions regarding the validity of the model, and to propose model and experiment improvements based on the processed data.</li>
      <li>...draw conclusions and make recommendations regarding the applicability and economic viability of the considered energy transport and storage system in the real-world setting, making use of the validated model.
      </li>
    </ol> 

    <p>To train you for performing the experimental validation, as part of this project, a measurement training is provided. In the measurement training, you will...</p>

    <ol start="8">
    <li>...use measurement equipment (sensors, filters, measurement cards, etc.) and corresponding software to interpret experimental data.</li>

    <p>
	It is required that each student attends all meetings connected to the project, that is: all tutor supervised and self-managed group meetings; all project supporting lectures, training courses, student meetings, etc.
	</p>
  
  	<p>
  	Absence is only excused when it concerns an acceptable reason (to be determined by the DBL coordinator). Requests for excused absence have to be submitted in advance to the DBL coordinator. The student will be notified as soon as possible whether the request has been approved.
	</p>

	<p>
	Arriving late to a group meeting is also considered a no-show.

	<h3 id="planning">Project planning and documentation</h3>
	Your group is responsible for developing and maintaining the planning and documentation of your project. The planning and documentation should be stored in your Group's Canvas folder using the following structure:

    <figure>
      <img src="assets/GroupFolder.png" alt="Group folder" style="width:80%">
    </figure>

    The various planning and documentation items are:

	<h4 id="ganttchart">Group's Gantt chart</h4>
	Your group must prepare and maintain a <em>general planning of the project</em>, including key activities, milestones and deliverables. The use of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart">Gantt chart</a> is recommended. Your group is free to select its own template (plenty can be found online). The Gantt chart must be available and up-to-date in your Group's Canvas folder at all times.

	<h4 id="actionitemlist">Group's action list</h4>
	Your group must maintain an <em>action item list</em> following	<a href="assets/Action list template.xlsx">this</a> template.  Note that the pre-listed action items on the template are mandatory for all groups. The action item list should be up-to-date on Canvas at all times.

	<h4 id="actionitemreport">Action item documention</h4>
	<p>
	Each of the action items should be documented in an <em>action item report</em> based on <a href="assets/Action_item_report_template.docx">this</a> template. The reports must be posted in the Group's Canvas folder using the file name convention <em>ItemNr_ShortDescription.docx</em>. All reports must be up-to-date before all group meetings.
	</p>

    <p>
	An action item report documents the work conducted for an action item, and can consist of, for example:
	<ul>
		<li>A literature review
		<li>A mathematical derivation
		<li>Photos of building activities (for the set-up)
		<li>A section of a report
		<li>A video
		<li>A practical description of the work carried out
		<li>...	
	</ul>
	</p>

    <h3 id="budget">Experimental setup budget</h3>

		<p> Each 4GB00 group receives a budget of €60 to build an experimental setup to validate (a part of) the developed model. The expenses are paid in advance by the group and will be reimbursed to one of the group members by the end of the project, provided that:</p>

        <ol>
        	<li>The experimental setup, which is the property of TU/e, is handed in at the final presentation.</li>
        	<li>A <em>Bill of Materials (BoM)</em> is included in the report to show how the budget was used. Note that the BoM should also include home materials of substantial value and that the total value on the BoM shold not exceed the total budget of €60.</li>
        	<li>One student per group submits a signed <em>reclaim form</em> to the 4GB00 organization at the final presentation.</li>
        </ol>

    <h3 id="experimentguidelines">Guidelines regarding the experimental setup</h3>
   
    	<ul>
    		<li>Follow the <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/about-the-university/security/">safety and security</a> rules of TU/e at all times.</li>
    		<li>Save money by avoiding transport fees. Instead, try to purchase your products locally. Think, for example, of the following suppliers:
    		</li>
    		    <ul>
    		    	<li><a href="https://www.tinytronics.nl/">Tinytronics</a> (Eindhoven)</li>
    		    	<li><a href="https://www.brigatti.nl/">Brigatti electronics</a> (Eindhoven)</li>
    		    	<li><a href="https://www.sossolutions.nl/">SOS solutions</a> (Eindhoven)</li>
    		    	<li><a href="https://www.hornbach.nl/">Hornbach</a> (Best)</li>
    		    </ul>
    		<li>If you do order online, make sure to do so at suppliers in The Netherlands. Experience shows that ordering from abroad will lead problems such as unexpected <em>high import taxes</em> and shipment delays.</li>
            <li>If you decide to purchase batteries, note that:</li>
            <ul>
            	<li>The <em>use of LiPo batteries is not allowed</em> in this course due to the involved safety risks. Instead purchase NiCD or NiMH batteries</li>
            	<li>Some battery systems require expensive external chargers. Take this into consideration in your budget.</li>
            	<li>In case of a fire: DO NOT EXTINGUISH WITH WATER! When a battery is thickened or smoking, take it out via the shortest route and cover it with
sand. In case of a fire on campus: call 2222 (= emergency number) and leave the room.
Do not breathe in the smoke or gases! These are very toxic.</li>
    	</ul>
